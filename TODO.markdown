TODO

- maybe I should just use the existing blogger file name as my file name? (I will lose ordering when there are two+ posts in the same day)
- create CSS/HTML template for single page
- create new post generator
    - takes in a markdown filename and outputs an html file
- create blogger xml to new css/html template
